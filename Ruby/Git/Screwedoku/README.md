This exercise relies on the structure of an existing repo, which can be downloaded from the page linked above,
or forked from [this repo](https://github.com/appacademy/screwedoku)

## In a nutshell
* We are provided with a repo containing a cli sudoku game.
* On the master branch, the game is working as intended but there are several error branches
* The task is to checkout each branch and resolve the errors in that branch.

## Navigating the solution
Opening the folder above will take you to my fork of the repo. The latest commit on each branch contains the solution for the code issues in that branch.
